These tasks were submitted by me to complete Java course at Jagiellonian University in Krakow.
Some of task contents are in pdf file and some were deleted before I was able to save them. 
I will try to write the lacking one down here:
1. Write an algorithm that allows to calculate sin(x) * cos(x) with given formula: -1^N * 2^(2*N) * x^(2*N+1)/factorial(2 * N + 1). There will be 4 parameters, N, X_FIRST, X_LAST, STEPS:

 - N - amount of approximation points, 
 - X_FIRST - x to start from, 
 - X_LAST - x where it all ends, 
 - STEPS = how many steps are between X_START and X_STOP.


2. Write a Class with name SimpleCalculations that will use Point class and implement some methods to operate on Points. Methods to implement:
 - equidistantPoints(Point[] p) - return all equidistant Points in given set of Points
 - geometricCenter(Point[] p) - return geometric center off points(center of mass)
 - next(Point[] p) - return point that is placed where the next point on line should be
